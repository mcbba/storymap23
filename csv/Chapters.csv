Welcome!,media/1NcGGriRaNWYYCRZgKnYcDZlJ9YbfjCCL.jpg,,,"Hello and welcome to the Marin County Breeding Bird Atlas story map for 2023! As new submissions come in they are added to the end of this list in the order they are recieved. As you scroll down the list you will see lots of awesome volunteer submitted photos of what they saw in their block along with a little backstory on their photo. The pins represent the center point of a survey block, they <b><u>do not</u></b> represent bird locations. All identifying information on sensitive species has been removed. Click on the photos to see them full screen. If you are a volunteer who has just made a submission it may take up to a week for the photo to show in this map, although your story should appear very quickly.",10,Hidden,blue,Welcome!,38.07294,-122.73438,,,,,10

Found a Black Phoebe doing food carries to a nest just under the peaked gable of a barn.

Six Cedar Waxwings swooped in to a big clump of English Ivy.  Two came out on a branch with an ivy berry in the bill of the bird on the right.  They passed the berry back and forth from beak to beak until on the seventh pass, the left hand bird ate the berry.   We think this was an example of courtship behavior while on migration",14,Plain,blue,9-7,38.05211,-122.73438,,,,,

My daughter, Linnea, was hiking Mt.Burdell and observed the adult female Downy Woodpecker peeking out of the nest cavity while crossing a bridge over a seasonal stream. We went back later in the week and got this photo. Downy Woodpecker currently isn't listed here, so this is a new confirmed breeder for this block!",14,Plain,blue,11-12,38.13542,-122.57813,,,,,

It's shaded, protected from rain and the elements, and there are bird feeders just across the fence at our neighbors! Smart birds. The mate is always nearby, often perched on a wire across the street. Needless to say, we will have to borrow a neighbor's ladder if we need one in the next few months.",14,Plain,blue,12-19,38.05211,-122.54688,,,,,

There is a lot of breeding bird activity around the now abandoned Randall House (rare bats also inside the house I believe). Cliff Swallows in the eaves, Starlings have created cavities around the window frames (so perhaps nests inside the house) and nooks and crannies around the house, also in the dead trees of the former yard/garden, a Black Phoebe nest last year. There are always Quaill around, Purple Finch, Band Tailed Pidgeons and across the street and into the woods Black Headed Grosbeak, Thrushes and who knows what else. I believe there is active research on the Owls of the area also. It's a cool place to contemplate if you happen to be in the area.  ",14,Plain,blue,10-3,37.96877,-122.73438,,,,,

I didn't see anything in it except an old TUVU feather but I heard an eerie roaring wind sound that I learned from Birds of the World was from a 10-20 day old TUVU nestling. I went back on June 28 and found this downy chick at the bottom of the stump. By July 10 it was still there but was so dark I could barely see it as it had lost most of its downy feathers. I hope to catch it in another 10-20 days when it should wedge itself up out of the stump, which is how the adults get in and out to feed it!",14,Plain,blue,9-16,38.09377,-122.64063,,,,,

Given the time of year, I inferred that they were a mated pair and would nest. I was never able to verify that; I did not see or hear them later in the season. I keep looking!

We immediately stopped, looked down, and found a small depression in a grass-lined hollow with five pale jellybean-sized eggs. We counted the eggs and moved on quickly so the sparrow could return to her nest. ",14,Plain,blue,5-2,38.23959,-122.82813,,,,,
